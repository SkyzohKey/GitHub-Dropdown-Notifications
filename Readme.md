# GitHub-Dropdown-Notifications
Tweaked version of the [GitHub Notifications Dropdown ](https://openuserjs.org/scripts/joeytwiddle/Github_Notifications_Dropdown/) (v.0.8.5) by [joeytwiddle](https://openuserjs.org/scripts/joeytwiddle/) on [OpenUserJS](https://openuserjs.org).

## Description
You can view your GitHub notifications from any GitHub page. Clicking the notifications icon will produce a dropdown. (You can still click the link at the bottom to get to the full notifications page.)

* Repositories can be collapsed by clicking their header.
* Notifications can be marked as read in the normal way. (Note this only applies to those visible notifications for each repository.)
* This script also makes files in diff views collapsible.
